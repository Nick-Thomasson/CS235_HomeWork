*Example program output:*

#+ATTR_HTML: :class console
#+BEGIN_SRC terminal :class terminal
integer size:  4
float size:    4
double size:   8
bool size:     1
char size:     1
string size:   32
#+END_SRC

*Create a project:*

- Start by creating a new project in your IDE. Put your project in the =practice1_sizes= folder.
- After creating a project, *add a new file* to your project, named "sizes.cpp".

In your .cpp file, start by creating your basic empty C++ program:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :class cpp
int main()
{
  return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

We're going to be using =cout= and =string= for this program, so make sure to
have =#include <iostream>=, =#include <string>=, and =using namespace std;= at the top of the file.

*Getting the size of each data type:*

We're going to use the =sizeof()= function to see the size of different data types.
We can call this function like: =sizeof( int )= and it will return a number, in bytes:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :class cpp
  cout << "integer size:  " << sizeof( int ) << endl;
#+END_SRC

Finish writing the program by doing the same for the following data types:
- float
- double
- bool
- char
- string
